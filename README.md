## Introduction
Hello and welcome! If you are reading this, then you have chosen to give our SRE Code Challenge a try. Splendid! You've got this.

Software Engineering interviewing is something our industry has never done very well.
We've tried to find the right blend of respecting your time and ensuring you will be  successful in our organization as an SRE.

This challenge will give you a taste of the kind of real work an SRE on our team performs.
A mix between coding, networking, infrastructure, and observability.

## Level-Set Expectations
- Most people invest 3-4 hours into this
- You don't have to solve everything, in fact we expect you not to! Work in priority order and come prepared to chat in our debrief about any struggles you encounter. The real interview is communicating about how you're solving these problems!
- If you don't know something or it doesn't make sense. Reach out, on the job you will be able to tap colleagues for help and expect the same here!
- We expect your work to be done in a branch and submitted as a pull request to main. We'll do the code review of your PR together!

## The task
Tackle these requirements in priority order.
(Again, don't worry if you don't finish them all! Get through what you can and be prepared to chat about it.)
- Write automation that deploys Wordpress v5.7.2 to a public cloud
- Write & push the code to a public git repo somewhere and send it's link to staff@trustd.solutions

## Bonus points!
- Use a managed Kubernetes offering to do so
- Use bitnami's Helm Chart: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/wordpress
- What CI/CD strategy would you recommend for this workload?
